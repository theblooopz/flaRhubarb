Just a little extension script for Flash 8 Professional to work with Rhubarb lip syncing

Put Rhubarb.jsfl in the "Commands" folder and rhubarb.xml in the XULControls folder.

1. Create empty graphic symbol, set to Play Once
2. Go into its edit mode, make the first keyframe a graphic symbol of the rhubarb phonemes in alphabetical order and set to single frame
3. Then, launch the rhubarb command and paste in the simple rhubarb data into the text box.
4. Click OK

It should populate the timeline with the appropriate keyframes.

Note: Need to use Rhuubarb output with tabs instead of spaces. Need to manually edit the framerate if it's not 30 FPS.
