Just a little extension script for Flash 8 Professional to work with Rhubarb lip syncing

To install, open the flaRhubarb.mxp, or put Rhubarb.jsfl in the "Commands" folder and rhubarb.xml in the XULControls folder.

1. Create empty graphic symbol, set to Play Once
2. Go into its edit mode, make the first keyframe a graphic symbol of the rhubarb phonemes in alphabetical order and set to single frame
3. Then, launch the rhubarb command and paste in the simple rhubarb data (using tabs) into the text box. Make sure the framerate matches.
4. Click OK

It should populate the timeline with the appropriate keyframes.
